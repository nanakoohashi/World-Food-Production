# Agriculture Data - README

## Summary
Tonnes of food are produced worldwide on a daily basis. This project aims to show the amount of food produced by the countries around the world by item type.

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
- Windows 10
### Libraries
- pandas
- zipfile
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

## Steps
### 1. Gather data
I started this project by importing essential packages and reading the .csv file. 
### 2. Assess the data 
Using common data assessing code, I assessed the data and looked for any issues with the type of data and format of the data in the two datasets. 
### 3. Clean the data
I fixed the issues I found while assessing the data, merged the two data sets, and prepared the new data set for visualization.
### 4. Visualize
I used Tableau to visualize the data from the cleaned data sets.
### 5. Export
Wrote DataFrame to a .csv file

## Findings
