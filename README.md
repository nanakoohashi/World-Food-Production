### 1. Gather data

### 2. Assess the data 
Using common data assessing code, I assessed the data and looked for any issues with the type of data and format of the data in the two datasets. 
### 3. Clean the data
I fixed the issues I found while assessing the data, merged the two data sets, and prepared the new data set for visualization.
### 4. Visualize
